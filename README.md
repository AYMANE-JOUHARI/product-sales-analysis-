## **1. Data Validation & Cleaning**
Before performing the analysis, I validated and cleaned the dataset to ensure data quality. Below are the **validation and cleaning steps** for each column:

### **âœ” Column-Wise Validation & Cleaning**
| **Column**            | **Validation & Cleaning Steps** |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
| **week**             | Checked for missing values (Clean). |
| **sales_method**     | Standardized text format to lowercase. Fixed inconsistencies (e.g., 'em +' replaced with 'email +') (Clean). |
| **customer_id**      | Verified uniqueness of IDs (No duplicates, Clean). |
| **nb_sold**         | Checked for missing values (Clean). |
| **revenue**         | - Identified missing values (more than 5%, so not removed). <br> - Used median imputation (since revenue is left-skewed). |
| **years_as_customer** | - Ensured values do not exceed `(2025-1984 = 41 years)`. <br> - Replaced outliers with the median. |
| **nb_site_visits**  | Checked for missing values (Clean). |
| **state**           | Checked categories for inconsistencies (Clean). |

Outcome: The dataset is now clean and ready for analysis.

## **3. Business Metric to Monitor**
### **Metric: Average Revenue per Customer**
**Formula:**  
Avg Revenue per Customer = Total Revenue / Total Customers


**Initial Value from Data:**
Initial Avg Revenue per Customer: 93.62


### **How to Monitor This Metric?**
- Track weekly and monthly in a dashboard.
- Set up alerts if it drops below X% of the average.
- Compare performance by sales method.

---

## **4. Final Summary & Recommendations**
### **Key Takeaways**
- Email had the most customers but moderate revenue per customer.
- Email + Call had fewer customers but the highest revenue per customer.
- Call-only was the least effective method (low total revenue, low per-customer revenue).
- Revenue is increasing over time, but growth is fastest with Email + Call.

### **Business Recommendation**
1. Prioritize "Email + Call" for high-value customers (as it generates the highest revenue per customer).  
2. Use "Email-only" for mass outreach (to minimize team effort while reaching the most customers).  
3. Reduce reliance on "Call-only" (since it requires high effort but produces low revenue).  

Outcome: This strategy will maximize revenue while optimizing team resources.

### **Next Steps**
- Build a real-time dashboard to track average revenue per customer.  
- Re-evaluate sales strategy every 6 weeks.  
- Experiment with personalized email strategies to improve engagement.
